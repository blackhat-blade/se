## compile
small perl program that takes a space engineers script, wraps some code around it to make it standalone compileable and uses csc.exe to compile it to a dll. The dll isn't of much use (afaik). However the compiler does full error checking, with nice reporting, without irrelvant warnings and other crap.Won't output anything except errors.

### install
adapt the paths to your system.

### usage
perl compile FILE.cs
